Auto Reaver - multiple access point attack using Reaver

This is bash script which provides multiple access point attack using reaver and BSSIDs list from a text file.

If processed AP reaches rate limit, script goes to another from the list, and so forth.

HOW IT WORKS ?

Script takes AP targets list from text file in following format
BSSID CHANNEL ESSID

For example:

AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 1 MyWlan 
00:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF 13 TpLink 
00:22:33:DD:EE:FF 13 MyHomeSSID

And then following steps are being processed:

    Every line of list file is checked separately in for loop
    After every AP on the list once, script automatically changes MAC address of your card to random MAC using macchanger (you can also setup your own MAC if you need),
    Whole list is checked again and again, in endless while loop, until there is nothing to check loop is stopped,
    Found PINS/WPA PASSPHRASES are stored in {CRACKED_LIST_FILE_PATH} file.
