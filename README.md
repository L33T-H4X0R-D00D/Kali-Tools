Kali-Tools
==========

This is an auto configuration script for the Kali VM provided by offensive security found [here](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/). This script installs and configures frequently used tools, and creates a directory on the desktop with common instructions for use. The main goal was to configure a fresh Kali VM while avoiding the common pitfalls normally associated with such an endeavor.


To get started copy and paste this link to kickoff the installation.

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/L33T-H4X0R-D00D/Kali-Tools/master/kalisetup.sh && chmod +x ./kalisetup.sh && ./kalisetup.sh

**Note:** This is still a non-working draft and does not follow *any* best practices whatsoever. I know there are better ways to do things.  I'm sure your way is very clever.  I'm publishing this to make my life easier when I have to rebuild a Kali VM. I might as well share with the public.
